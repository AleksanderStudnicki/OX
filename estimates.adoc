= Estimates for 18.12.2019:

== Optimistic:

- First master commit with some code
- Simple ability to game

== Realistic:

- Packages
- Demo of boards representation on demo branch
- Few classes written with a little help from TDD

== Pessimistic:

- Few classes written without TDD, maybe with some tests
- Branches structure (master, development, demo, review)
